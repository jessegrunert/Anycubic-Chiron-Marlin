# Anycubic Chiron Marlin Firmware
Marlin 1.1.x-bugfix Firmware as configured by myself with many thanks to Kris Waclawski for getting me started on this.

I've made a few tweaks to the settings and added the software endstops as this is my preference. Recently I have upgraded my stepper drivers to LV8729's and calibrated Linear Advance.

## Chiron Features
Since this is a port from the V1.3 firmware which anycubic built, not all features are working. That being said, the features which are not working, I've never used them anyway, so this is fine for me. Perhaps it will be an issue for you, up to you to decide.

### Tested Working
- Filmament sensor
- G29 auto leveling (I added a bit more probe clearance as I didn't like the default values)

### Tested NOT Working
- Mesh editing via LCD screen

### NOT Tested
- Resume after power failure


more to come....
